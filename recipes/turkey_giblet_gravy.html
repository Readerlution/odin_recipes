        alt='Gravy to be topped on your stuffed turkey!' style="height: 500px;width: 450px;">
    
    <p>Here's a classic recipe for silky-smooth, deeply-flavored gravy that will have guest 
        singing your praises! It makes enough for the table and the turkey leftovers. 
        If giblets aren't your thing or your bird came without them, skip to step 3 and 
        prepare as directed, substituting canned broth for the homemade giblet broth. 
        Keep warm until serving, whisking occasionally.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 serving giblets (turkey neck, heart, and gizzard)</li>
            <li>½ unpeeled yellow onion, rinsed</li>
            <li>7 cups water, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup turkey drippings, or as much is produced</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li> 
        </ul>
    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir giblets and onion until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water to onion mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer until liquid is reduced by 1/3 and meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a measuring cup to measure 4 cups. Add more water if needed to make 4 cups.</li>
            <li>Place the turkey roasting pan with drippings over 2 burners on low heat; add 1 cup water and stir to release brown bits of food.</li>
            <li>Pour drippings into a fat separator or a small bowl and allow fat to rise to the top; skim off excess fat and transfer to a 1-cup measuring cup. Fat should equal 3/4 cup; add butter if needed to get to 3/4 cup fat. Strain liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 2-cup measuring cup, adding more water to equal 2 cups if needed.</li>
            <li>Combine the 2 cups drippings liquid and 4 cups broth in a bowl and cool.</li>
            <li>Heat fat in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour until mixture is smooth and light brown, about 2 minutes. Gradually mix broth mixture into fat mixture using a whisk until smooth; bring to a boil and cook at a full boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until gravy is thickened about 15 minutes. Season gravy with salt and pepper.</li>
