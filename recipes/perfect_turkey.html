        alt='The Perfect Stuffed Turkey' style="height: 500px;width: 450px;">
    
    <p>A perfectly seasoned and juicy turkey. My friend from France taught me to
        cook turkey like this, but she never measures anything so use your own 
        judgment for vegetable amounts, etc. I usually err on the side of 
        'more is better'! </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
            <li>2 cups kosher salt</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 large onions, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>4 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the turkey inside and out with the kosher salt. 
                Place the bird in a large stock pot, and cover with cold water. 
                Place in the refrigerator, and allow the turkey to soak in the salt
                 and water mixture 12 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly 
                rinse the turkey, and discard the brine mixture.</li>
            <li>Brush the turkey with 1/2 the melted butter. Place breast side 
                down on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff the 
                turkey cavity with 1 onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 
                1 sprig of thyme, and the bay leaf. Scatter the remaining 
                vegetables and thyme around the bottom of the roasting pan, 
                and cover with the white wine.</li>
            <li>Roast uncovered 3 1/2 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, 
                until the internal temperature of the thigh reaches 180 
                degrees F (85 degrees C). Carefully turn the turkey breast 
                side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with 
                the remaining butter. Allow the bird to stand about 30 
                minutes before carving.</li>
